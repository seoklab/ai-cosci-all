**Research Question:**
"{user_question}"

**Your Task:**
Analyze this question and design a team of {max_team_size} specialized scientific agents to solve it.
Each agent should bring unique, complementary expertise.

For each agent, provide:
1. **title**: Role title (e.g., "Immunologist", "Data Scientist", "Structural Biologist")
2. **expertise**: Specific domain knowledge they bring
3. **goal**: What they should accomplish in this research
4. **role**: Their specific responsibilities in the team meeting

**Important Guidelines:**
- Choose specialists whose expertise DIRECTLY addresses the research question
- Avoid redundant roles - each agent should contribute something unique
- Consider: Does this need computational analysis? Literature review? Domain expertise? Data analysis?
- Prefer specialists over generalists
- Common useful roles: Computational Biologist, Bioinformatician, Immunologist, Oncologist,
  Data Scientist, Structural Biologist, Systems Biologist, Drug Discovery Specialist, etc.

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON array of {max_team_size} agent specifications. No explanation.

Example format:
[
    {{
        "title": "Computational Biologist",
        "expertise": "Sequence analysis, protein structure prediction, bioinformatics algorithms",
        "goal": "Design and validate the binder sequence using computational methods",
        "role": "Generate candidate sequences and predict their biophysical properties"

        "title": "Immunologist",
