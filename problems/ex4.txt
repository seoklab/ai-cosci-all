[P4] Discovery of Therapeutic Targets for Pulmonary Fibrosis: Inhibitor Candidate Design Based on the IL-11 Interaction Network
Pulmonary fibrosis (especially Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF) is a progressive disease characterized by the irreversible hardening and functional decline of lung tissue. A major limitation is that currently approved therapies (e.g., anti-fibrotic agents) cannot entirely halt the disease's progression. Recent research indicates that IL-11 (Interleukin-11) is a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, playing an important role in fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, and inflammation–fibrosis signaling links. It is also gaining attention as a factor associated with tissue aging and systemic aging-related pathophysiology. Newly identified interactors of IL-11 are emerging as core nodes in the fibrosis-aging network.

The objective of this problem is to integrate and analyze the latest literature and data on IL-11 signaling and its associated interactors in pulmonary fibrosis, with the goal of predicting the inhibitory target candidates that can most effectively block the fibrotic pathway and presenting the scientific rationale. 

If necessary, the analysis should also consider how the aging-related pathways involving IL-11 are connected to fibrosis. 

The following roles are required for this:
1. Literature Analysis (latest papers on IL-11, OMICs data, reviews, etc.)
2. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network and Pathway Network Modeling
3. Hypothesis-driven Reasoning (defining the most influential nodes/interactions for fibrosis and aging inhibition)

Present an analysis and design strategy that satisfies both requirements (A) and (B) below.

(A) Analysis of IL-11 and IL-11 Interacting Factors Driving Pulmonary Fibrosis
1. Summarize the roles of IL-11 related to pulmonary fibrosis and aging.
2. Integrate a list of newly reported IL-11 interactors.
3. Model the Protein-Protein Interaction network and fibrosis/aging pathways.
4. Propose final target candidates and rationale.

(B) Proposal for a Binder that can effectively inhibit IL-11 and its Interacting Factors (from a Biologics Design perspective)
1. Define the Target Class and Modality.
2. Binder design strategy (conceptual level).
3. Propose hypotheses regarding the efficacy on fibrosis and aging inhibition, and safety.
