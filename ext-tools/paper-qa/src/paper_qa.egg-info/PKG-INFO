              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

PaperQA2 is a package for doing high-accuracy retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on PDFs, text files, Microsoft Office documents, and source code files,
with a focus on the scientific literature.
See our [recent 2024 paper](https://paper.wikicrow.ai)
to see examples of PaperQA2's superhuman performance in scientific tasks like
question answering, summarization, and contradiction detection.

## Quickstart

In this example we take a folder of research paper PDFs,
magically get their metadata - including citation counts with a retraction check,
then parse and cache PDFs into a full-text search index,
and finally answer the user question with an LLM agent.

```bash
pip install paper-qa
mkdir my_papers
curl -o my_papers/PaperQA2.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13740
cd my_papers
pqa ask 'What is PaperQA2?'
```

### Example Output

Question: Has anyone designed neural networks that compute with proteins or DNA?

> The claim that neural networks have been designed to compute with DNA is supported by multiple sources.
> The work by Qian, Winfree, and Bruck demonstrates the use of DNA strand displacement cascades
> to construct neural network components, such as artificial neurons and associative memories,
> using a DNA-based system (Qian2011Neural pages 1-2, Qian2011Neural pages 15-16, Qian2011Neural pages 54-56).
> This research includes the implementation of a 3-bit XOR gate and a four-neuron Hopfield associative memory,
> showcasing the potential of DNA for neural network computation.
> Additionally, the application of deep learning techniques to genomics,
> which involves computing with DNA sequences, is well-documented.
> Studies have applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict genomic features such as
> transcription factor binding and DNA accessibility (Eraslan2019Deep pages 4-5, Eraslan2019Deep pages 5-6).
> These models leverage DNA sequences as input data,
> effectively using neural networks to compute with DNA.
> While the provided excerpts do not explicitly mention protein-based neural network computation,
> they do highlight the use of neural networks in tasks related to protein sequences,
> such as predicting DNA-protein binding (Zeng2016Convolutional pages 1-2).
> However, the primary focus remains on DNA-based computation.

## What is PaperQA2

PaperQA2 is engineered to be the best agentic RAG model for working with scientific papers.
Here are some features:

- A simple interface to get good answers with grounded responses containing in-text citations.
- State-of-the-art implementation including document metadata-awareness
  in embeddings and LLM-based re-ranking and contextual summarization (RCS).
- Support for agentic RAG, where a language agent can iteratively refine queries and answers.
- Automatic redundant fetching of paper metadata,
  including citation and journal quality data from multiple providers.
- A usable full-text search engine for a local repository of PDF/text files.
- A robust interface for customization, with default support for all [LiteLLM][LiteLLM providers] models.

[LiteLLM providers]: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers
[LiteLLM general docs]: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/

By default, it uses [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
and [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) with a Numpy vector DB to embed and search documents.
However, you can easily use other closed-source, open-source models or embeddings (see details below).

PaperQA2 depends on some awesome libraries/APIs that make our repo possible.
Here are some in no particular order:

1. [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)
2. [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/)
3. [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/)
4. [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
5. [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy)
6. [LiteLLM][LiteLLM general docs]

We've been working on hard on fundamental upgrades for a while and mostly followed [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
meaning we've incremented the major version number on each breaking change.
This brings us to the current major version number v5.
So why call is the repo now called PaperQA2?
We wanted to remark on the fact though that we've
exceeded human performance on [many important metrics](https://paper.wikicrow.ai).
So we arbitrarily call version 5 and onward PaperQA2,
and versions before it as PaperQA1 to denote the significant change in performance.
We recognize that we are challenged at naming and counting at FutureHouse,
so we reserve the right at any time to arbitrarily change the name to PaperCrow.

### What's New in Version 5 (aka PaperQA2)?

Version 5 added:

- A CLI `pqa`
- Agentic workflows invoking tools for
  paper search, gathering evidence, and generating an answer
- Removed much of the statefulness from the `Docs` object
- A migration to LiteLLM for compatibility with many LLM providers
  as well as centralized rate limits and cost tracking
- A bundled set of configurations (read [this section here](#bundled-settings)))
  containing known-good hyperparameters

Note that `Docs` objects pickled from prior versions of `PaperQA` are incompatible with version 5,
and will need to be rebuilt.
Also, our minimum Python version was increased to Python 3.11.

### PaperQA2 Algorithm

To understand PaperQA2, let's start with the pieces of the underlying algorithm.
The default workflow of PaperQA2 is as follows:

| Phase                  | PaperQA2 Actions                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Paper Search**    | - Get candidate papers from LLM-generated keyword query                   |
|                        | - Chunk, embed, and add candidate papers to state                         |
| **2. Gather Evidence** | - Embed query into vector                                                 |
|                        | - Rank top _k_ document chunks in current state                           |
|                        | - Create scored summary of each chunk in the context of the current query |
|                        | - Use LLM to re-score and select most relevant summaries                  |
| **3. Generate Answer** | - Put best summaries into prompt with context                             |
|                        | - Generate answer with prompt                                             |

The tools can be invoked in any order by a language agent.
For example, an LLM agent might do a narrow and broad search,
or using different phrasing for the gather evidence step from the generate answer step.

## Installation

For a non-development setup,
install PaperQA2 (aka version 5) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/paper-qa/).
Note version 5 requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
pip install paper-qa>=5
```

For development setup,
please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

PaperQA2 uses an LLM to operate,
so you'll need to either set an appropriate [API key environment variable][LiteLLM providers]
(i.e. `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`)
or set up an open source LLM server (i.e. using [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile).
Any LiteLLM compatible model can be configured to use with PaperQA2.

If you need to index a large set of papers (100+),
you will likely want an API key for both
[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/metadata-plus/metadata-plus-keys/)
and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key),
which will allow you to avoid hitting public rate limits using these metadata services.
Those can be exported as `CROSSREF_API_KEY` and `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` variables.

## CLI Usage

The fastest way to test PaperQA2 is via the CLI. First navigate to a directory with some papers and use the `pqa` cli:

```bash
pqa ask 'What is PaperQA2?'
```

You will see PaperQA2 index your local PDF files,
gathering the necessary metadata for each of them
(using [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)),
search over that index, then break the files into chunked evidence contexts,
rank them, and ultimately generate an answer.
The next time this directory is queried,
your index will already be built (save for any differences detected, like new added papers),
so it will skip the indexing and chunking steps.

All prior answers will be indexed and stored,
you can view them by querying via the `search` subcommand,
or access them yourself in your `PQA_HOME` directory,
which defaults to `~/.pqa/`.

```bash
pqa -i 'answers' search 'ranking and contextual summarization'
```

PaperQA2 is highly configurable, when running from the command line,
`pqa --help` shows all options and short descriptions.
For example to run with a higher temperature:

```bash
pqa --temperature 0.5 ask 'What is PaperQA2?'
```

You can view all settings with `pqa view`.
Another useful thing is to change to other templated settings - for example
`fast` is a setting that answers more quickly
and you can see it with `pqa -s fast view`

Maybe you have some new settings you want to save? You can do that with

```bash
pqa -s my_new_settings --temperature 0.5 --llm foo-bar-5 save
```

and then you can use it with

```bash
pqa -s my_new_settings ask 'What is PaperQA2?'
```

If you run `pqa` with a command which requires a new indexing,
say if you change the default chunk_size,
a new index will automatically be created for you.

```bash
pqa --parsing.chunk_size 5000 ask 'What is PaperQA2?'
```

You can also use `pqa` to do full-text search with use of LLMs view the search command.
For example, let's save the index from a directory and give it a name:

```bash
pqa -i nanomaterials index
```

Now I can search for papers about thermoelectrics:

```bash
pqa -i nanomaterials search thermoelectrics
```

or I can use the normal ask

```bash
pqa -i nanomaterials ask 'Are there nm scale features in thermoelectric materials?'
```

Both the CLI and module have pre-configured settings based on prior performance and our publications,
they can be invoked as follows:

```bash
pqa --settings <setting name> \
    ask 'Are there nm scale features in thermoelectric materials?'
```

### Bundled Settings

Inside [`src/paperqa/configs`](src/paperqa/configs) we bundle known useful settings:

| Setting Name | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| high_quality | Highly performant, relatively expensive (due to having `evidence_k` = 15) query using a `ToolSelector` agent.                |
| fast         | Setting to get answers cheaply and quickly.                                                                                  |
| wikicrow     | Setting to emulate the Wikipedia article writing used in our WikiCrow publication.                                           |
| contracrow   | Setting to find contradictions in papers, your query should be a claim that needs to be flagged as a contradiction (or not). |
| debug        | Setting useful solely for debugging, but not in any actual application beyond debugging.                                     |
| tier1_limits | Settings that match OpenAI rate limits for each tier, you can use `tier<1-5>_limits` to specify the tier.                    |

### Rate Limits

If you are hitting rate limits, say with the OpenAI Tier 1 plan, you can add them into PaperQA2.
For each OpenAI tier, a pre-built setting exists to limit usage.

```bash
pqa --settings 'tier1_limits' ask 'What is PaperQA2?'
```

This will limit your system to use the [tier1_limits](src/paperqa/configs/tier1_limits.json),
and slow down your queries to accommodate.

You can also specify them manually with any rate limit string that matches the specification in
the [limits](https://limits.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#rate-limit-string-notation) module:

```bash
pqa --summary_llm_config '{"rate_limit": {"gpt-4o-2024-11-20": "30000 per 1 minute"}}' \
    ask 'What is PaperQA2?'
```

Or by adding into a `Settings` object, if calling imperatively:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(
        llm_config={"rate_limit": {"gpt-4o-2024-11-20": "30000 per 1 minute"}},
        summary_llm_config={"rate_limit": {"gpt-4o-2024-11-20": "30000 per 1 minute"}},
    ),
)
```

## Library Usage

PaperQA2's full workflow can be accessed via Python directly:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(temperature=0.5, paper_directory="my_papers"),
)
```

Please see our [installation docs](#installation) for how to install the package from PyPI.

### Agentic Adding/Querying Documents

The answer object has the following attributes:
`formatted_answer`, `answer` (answer alone), `question` , and `context` (the summaries of passages found for answer).
`ask` will use the `SearchPapers` tool, which will query a local index of files,
you can specify this location via the `Settings` object:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(temperature=0.5, paper_directory="my_papers"),
)
```

`ask` is just a convenience wrapper around the real entrypoint,
which can be accessed if you'd like to run concurrent asynchronous workloads:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, agent_query

answer_response = await agent_query(
    query="What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(temperature=0.5, paper_directory="my_papers"),
)
```

The default agent will use an LLM based agent,
but you can also specify a `"fake"` agent to use a hard coded call path of
search -> gather evidence -> answer to reduce token usage.

### Manual (No Agent) Adding/Querying Documents

Normally via agent execution, the agent invokes the search tool,
which adds documents to the `Docs` object for you behind the scenes.
However, if you prefer fine-grained control,
you can directly interact with the `Docs` object.

Note that manually adding and querying `Docs` does not impact performance.
It just removes the automation associated with an agent picking the documents to add.

```python
from paperqa import Docs, Settings

# valid extensions include .pdf, .txt, .md, .html, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, and code files (e.g., .py, .ts, .yaml)
doc_paths = ("myfile.pdf", "myotherfile.pdf")

# Prepare the Docs object by adding a bunch of documents
docs = Docs()
for doc_path in doc_paths:
    await docs.aadd(doc_path)

# Set up how we want to query the Docs object
settings = Settings()
settings.llm = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
settings.answer.answer_max_sources = 3

# Query the Docs object to get an answer
session = await docs.aquery("What is PaperQA2?", settings=settings)
print(session)
```

### Async

PaperQA2 is written to be used asynchronously.
The synchronous API is just a wrapper around the async.
Here are the methods and their `async` equivalents:

| Sync                | Async                |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `Docs.add`          | `Docs.aadd`          |
| `Docs.add_file`     | `Docs.aadd_file`     |
| `Docs.add_url`      | `Docs.aadd_url`      |
| `Docs.get_evidence` | `Docs.aget_evidence` |
| `Docs.query`        | `Docs.aquery`        |

The synchronous version just calls the async version in a loop.
Most modern python environments support `async` natively (including Jupyter notebooks!).
So you can do this in a Jupyter Notebook:

```python
import asyncio
from paperqa import Docs


async def main() -> None:
    docs = Docs()
    # valid extensions include .pdf, .txt, .md, .html, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, and code files (e.g., .py, .ts, .yaml)
    for doc in ("myfile.pdf", "myotherfile.pdf"):
        await docs.aadd(doc)

    session = await docs.aquery("What is PaperQA2?")
    print(session)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Choosing Model

By default, PaperQA2 uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` model for the
`summary_llm`, `llm`, and `agent_llm`.
Please see the [Settings Cheatsheet](#settings-cheatsheet)
for more information on these settings.
PaperQA2 also defaults to using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model for the `embedding` setting.
If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can use a different embedding model.
More information about embedding models can be found [in the "Embedding Model" section](#embedding-model).

We use the [`lmi`](https://github.com/Future-House/ldp/tree/main/packages/lmi) package for our LLM interface,
which in turn uses `litellm` to support many LLM providers.
You can adjust this easily to use any model supported by `litellm`:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(
        llm="gpt-4o-mini", summary_llm="gpt-4o-mini", paper_directory="my_papers"
    ),
)
```

To use Claude, make sure you set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.
In this example, we also use a different embedding model.
Please make sure to `pip install paper-qa[local]` to use a local embedding model.

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask
from paperqa.settings import AgentSettings

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(
        llm="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
        summary_llm="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
        agent=AgentSettings(agent_llm="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"),
        # SEE: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1
        embedding="st-multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1",
    ),
)
```

Or Gemini, by setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Google AI Studio

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask
from paperqa.settings import AgentSettings

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(
        llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash",
        summary_llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash",
        agent=AgentSettings(agent_llm="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash"),
        embedding="gemini/text-embedding-004",
    ),
)
```

#### Locally Hosted

You can use llama.cpp to be the LLM.
Note that you should be using relatively large models,
because PaperQA2 requires following a lot of instructions.
You won't get good performance with 7B models.

The easiest way to get set-up is to download a [llama file](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)
and execute it with `-cb -np 4 -a my-llm-model --embedding`
which will enable continuous batching and embeddings.

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

local_llm_config = dict(
    model_list=[
        dict(
            model_name="my_llm_model",
            litellm_params=dict(
                model="my-llm-model",
                api_base="http://localhost:8080/v1",
                api_key="sk-no-key-required",
                temperature=0.1,
                frequency_penalty=1.5,
                max_tokens=512,
            ),
        )
    ]
)

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(
        llm="my-llm-model",
        llm_config=local_llm_config,
        summary_llm="my-llm-model",
        summary_llm_config=local_llm_config,
    ),
)
```

Models hosted with `ollama` are also supported.
To run the example below make sure you have downloaded llama3.2 and mxbai-embed-large via ollama.

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

local_llm_config = {
    "model_list": [
        {
            "model_name": "ollama/llama3.2",
            "litellm_params": {
                "model": "ollama/llama3.2",
                "api_base": "http://localhost:11434",
            },
        }
    ]
}

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(
        llm="ollama/llama3.2",
        llm_config=local_llm_config,
        summary_llm="ollama/llama3.2",
        summary_llm_config=local_llm_config,
        embedding="ollama/mxbai-embed-large",
    ),
)
```

### Embedding Model

Embeddings are used to retrieve k texts (where k is specified via `Settings.answer.evidence_k`)
for re-ranking and contextual summarization.
If you don't want to use embeddings, but instead just fetch all chunks,
disable "evidence retrieval" via the `Settings.answer.evidence_retrieval` setting.

PaperQA2 defaults to using OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`) embeddings,
but has flexible options for both vector stores and embedding choices.

#### Specifying the Embedding Model

The simplest way to specify the embedding model is via `Settings.embedding`:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(embedding="text-embedding-3-large"),
)
```

`embedding` accepts any embedding model name supported by litellm.
PaperQA2 also supports an embedding input of `"hybrid-<model_name>"`
i.e. `"hybrid-text-embedding-3-small"` to use a hybrid sparse keyword (based on a token modulo embedding)
and dense vector embedding, where any litellm model can be used in the dense model name.
`"sparse"` can be used to use a sparse keyword embedding only.

Embedding models are used to create PaperQA2's index of the full-text embedding vectors (`texts_index` argument).
The embedding model can be specified as a setting when you are adding new papers to the `Docs` object:

```python
from paperqa import Docs, Settings

docs = Docs()
for doc in ("myfile.pdf", "myotherfile.pdf"):
    await docs.aadd(doc, settings=Settings(embedding="text-embedding-large-3"))
```

Note that PaperQA2 uses Numpy as a dense vector store.
Its design of using a keyword search initially reduces the number of chunks
needed for each answer to a relatively small number < 1k.
Therefore, `NumpyVectorStore` is a good place to start, it's a simple in-memory store, without an index.
However, if a larger-than-memory vector store is needed,
you can an external vector database like [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) via the `QdrantVectorStore` class.

The hybrid embeddings can be customized:

```python
from paperqa import (
    Docs,
    HybridEmbeddingModel,
    SparseEmbeddingModel,
    LiteLLMEmbeddingModel,
)


model = HybridEmbeddingModel(
    models=[LiteLLMEmbeddingModel(), SparseEmbeddingModel(ndim=1024)]
)
docs = Docs()
for doc in ("myfile.pdf", "myotherfile.pdf"):
    await docs.aadd(doc, embedding_model=model)
```

The sparse embedding (keyword) models default to having 256 dimensions,
but this can be specified via the `ndim` argument.

#### Local Embedding Models (Sentence Transformers)

You can use a `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel` model if you install `sentence-transformers`,
which is [a local embedding library](https://sbert.net/) with support for HuggingFace models and more.
You can install it by adding the `local` extras.

```sh
pip install paper-qa[local]
```

and then prefix embedding model names with `st-`:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(embedding="st-multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1"),
)
```

or with a hybrid model

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=Settings(embedding="hybrid-st-multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1"),
)
```

### Adjusting number of sources

You can adjust the numbers of sources (passages of text) to reduce token usage or add more context.
`k` refers to the top k most relevant and diverse (may from different sources) passages.
Each passage is sent to the LLM to summarize, or determine if it is irrelevant.
After this step, a limit of `max_sources` is applied so that the final answer can fit into the LLM context window.
Thus, `k` > `max_sources` and `max_sources` is the number of sources used in the final answer.

```python
from paperqa import Settings

settings = Settings()
settings.answer.answer_max_sources = 3
settings.answer.evidence_k = 5

await docs.aquery(
    "What is PaperQA2?",
    settings=settings,
)
```

### Using Code or HTML

You do not need to use papers -- you can use code or raw HTML.
Note that this tool is focused on answering questions,
so it won't do well at writing code.
One note is that the tool cannot infer citations from code,
so you will need to provide them yourself.

```python
import glob
import os
from paperqa import Docs

source_files = glob.glob("**/*.js")

docs = Docs()
for f in source_files:
    # this assumes the file names are unique in code
    await docs.aadd(
        f, citation="File " + os.path.basename(f), docname=os.path.basename(f)
    )
session = await docs.aquery("Where is the search bar in the header defined?")
print(session)
```

### Multimodal Support

Multimodal support centers on:

- Standalone images
- Images or tables in PDFs

The `Docs` object stores media via a `ParsedMedia` object.
When chunking a document, media are not split at chunk boundaries,
so it's possible 2+ chunks can correspond with the same media.
This means within PaperQA each chunk
has a one-to-many relationship between `ParsedMedia` and chunks.

Depending on the source document, the same image can appear multiple times
(e.g. each page of a PDF has a logo in the margins).
Thus, clients should consider media databases
to have a many-to-many relationship with chunks.

Since PaperQA's evidence gathering process centers on text-based retrieval,
it's possible relevant image(s) or table(s) aren't retrieved
because their associated text content is irrelevant.
For a concrete example, imagine the figure in a paper has a terse caption
and is placed one page after relevant main-text discussion.
To solve this problem, PaperQA supports media enrichment at document read-time.
Basically after reading in the PDF,
the `parsing.enrichment_llm` is given the `parsing.enrichment_prompt`
and co-located text to generate a synthetic caption for every image/table.
The synthetic captions are used to shift the embeddings of each text chunk,
but are kept separate from the actual source text.
This way evidence gathering can fetch relevant images/tables
without risk of polluting contextual summaries with LLM-generated captions.

If you want multimodal PDF reading, but do not want enrichment
(since adds one LLM prompt/media at read-time),
enrichment can be disabled by setting `parsing.multimodal` to `ON_WITHOUT_ENRICHMENT`.

When creating contextual summaries on a given chunk (a `Text`),
the summary LLM is passed both the chunk's text and the chunk's associated media,
but the output contextual summary itself remains text-only.

If you would like,
specifying the prompt `paperqa.prompts.summary_json_multimodal_system_prompt`
to the setting `prompt.summary_json_system`
will include a `used_images` flag attributing
usage of images in any contextual summarizations.

### Using External DB/Vector DB and Caching

You may want to cache parsed texts and embeddings in an external database or file.
You can then build a Docs object from those directly:

```python
from paperqa import Docs, Doc, Text

docs = Docs()

for ... in my_docs:
    doc = Doc(docname=..., citation=..., dockey=..., citation=...)
    texts = [Text(text=..., name=..., doc=doc) for ... in my_texts]
    docs.add_texts(texts, doc)
```

### Creating Index

Indexes will be placed in the [home directory][home dir] by default.
This can be controlled via the `PQA_HOME` environment variable.

Indexes are made by reading files in the `Settings.paper_directory`.
By default, we recursively read from subdirectories of the paper directory,
unless disabled using `Settings.index_recursively`.
The paper directory is not modified in any way, it's just read from.

[home dir]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.home

#### Manifest Files

The indexing process attempts to infer paper metadata like title and DOI
using LLM-powered text processing.
You can avoid this point of uncertainty using a "manifest" file,
which is a CSV containing `DocDetails` fields (order doesn't matter).
For example:

- `file_location`: relative path to the paper's PDF within the index directory
- `doi`: DOI of the paper
- `title`: title of the paper

By providing this information,
we ensure queries to metadata providers like Crossref are accurate.

To ease creating a manifest, there is a helper class method `Doc.to_csv`,
which also works when called on `DocDetails`.

### Reusing Index

The local search indexes are built based on a hash of the current `Settings` object.
So make sure you properly specify the `paper_directory` to your `Settings` object.
In general, it's advisable to:

1. Pre-build an index given a folder of papers (can take several minutes)
2. Reuse the index to perform many queries

```python
import os

from paperqa import Settings
from paperqa.agents.main import agent_query
from paperqa.agents.search import get_directory_index


async def amain(folder_of_papers: str | os.PathLike) -> None:
    settings = Settings(paper_directory=folder_of_papers)

    # 1. Build the index. Note an index name is autogenerated when unspecified
    built_index = await get_directory_index(settings=settings)
    print(settings.get_index_name())  # Display the autogenerated index name
    print(await built_index.index_files)  # Display the index contents

    # 2. Use the settings as many times as you want with ask
    answer_response_1 = await agent_query(
        query="What is a cool retrieval augmented generation technique?",
        settings=settings,
    )
    answer_response_2 = await agent_query(
        query="What is PaperQA2?",
        settings=settings,
    )
```

### Using Clients Directly

One of the most powerful features of PaperQA2 is its ability to combine data from multiple metadata sources.
For example, [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) can provide open access status/direct links to PDFs,
[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) can provide bibtex,
and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) can provide citation licenses.
Here's a short demo of how to do this:

```python
from paperqa.clients import DocMetadataClient, ALL_CLIENTS

client = DocMetadataClient(metadata_clients=ALL_CLIENTS)
details = await client.query(title="Augmenting language models with chemistry tools")

print(details.formatted_citation)
# Andres M. Bran, Sam Cox, Oliver Schilter, Carlo Baldassari,
# Andrew D. White, and Philippe Schwaller.
#  Augmenting large language models with chemistry tools. Nature Machine Intelligence,
# 6:525-535, May 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00832-8,
# doi:10.1038/s42256-024-00832-8.
# This article has 243 citations and is from a domain leading peer-reviewed journal.

print(details.citation_count)
# 243

print(details.license)
# cc-by

print(details.pdf_url)
# https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00832-8.pdf
```

the `client.query` is meant to check for exact matches of title.
It's a bit robust (like to casing, missing a word).
There are duplicates for titles though - so you can also add authors to disambiguate.
Or you can provide a doi directly `client.query(doi="10.1038/s42256-024-00832-8")`.

If you're doing this at a large scale,
you may not want to use `ALL_CLIENTS` (just omit the argument)
and you can specify which specific fields you want to speed up queries.
For example:

```python
details = await client.query(
    title="Augmenting large language models with chemistry tools",
    authors=["Andres M. Bran", "Sam Cox"],
    fields=["title", "doi"],
)
```

will return much faster than the first query and we'll be certain the authors match.

## Where do I get papers?

Well that's a really good question!
It's probably best to just download PDFs of papers you think will help answer your question and start from there.

See detailed docs [about zotero, openreview and parsing](docs/tutorials/where_do_I_get_papers.md)

## Callbacks

To execute a function on each chunk of LLM completions,
you need to provide a function that can be executed on each chunk.
For example, to get a typewriter view of the completions, you can do:

```python
from paperqa import Docs


def typewriter(chunk: str) -> None:
    print(chunk, end="")


docs = Docs()

# add some docs...

await docs.aquery("What is PaperQA2?", callbacks=[typewriter])
```

### Caching Embeddings

In general, embeddings are cached when you pickle a `Docs` regardless of what vector store you use.
So as long as you save your underlying `Docs` object,
you should be able to avoid re-embedding your documents.

## Customizing Prompts

You can customize any of the prompts using settings.

```python
from paperqa import Docs, Settings

my_qa_prompt = (
    "Answer the question '{question}'\n"
    "Use the context below if helpful. "
    "You can cite the context using the key like (pqac-abcd1234). "
    "If there is insufficient context, write a poem "
    "about how you cannot answer.\n\n"
    "Context: {context}"
)

docs = Docs()
settings = Settings()
settings.prompts.qa = my_qa_prompt
await docs.aquery("What is PaperQA2?", settings=settings)
```

### Pre and Post Prompts

Following the syntax above, you can also include prompts that
are executed after the query and before the query.
For example, you can use this to critique the answer.

## FAQ

### How come I get different results than your papers?

Internally at FutureHouse, we have a slightly different set of tools.
We're trying to get some of them, like citation traversal, into this repo.
However, we have APIs and licenses to access research papers that we cannot share openly.
Similarly, in our research papers' results we do not start with the known relevant PDFs.
Our agent has to identify them using keyword search over all papers, rather than just a subset.
We're gradually aligning these two versions of PaperQA,
but until there is an open-source way to freely access papers (even just open source papers)
you will need to provide PDFs yourself.

### How is this different from LlamaIndex or LangChain?

[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
and [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)
are both frameworks for working with LLM applications,
with abstractions made for agentic workflows and retrieval augmented generation.

Over time, the PaperQA team over time chose to become framework-agnostic,
instead outsourcing LLM drivers to [LiteLLM][LiteLLM general docs]
and no framework besides Pydantic for its tools.
PaperQA focuses on scientific papers and their metadata.

PaperQA can be reimplemented using either LlamaIndex or LangChain.
For example, our `GatherEvidence` tool can be reimplemented
as a retriever with an LLM-based re-ranking and contextual summary.
There is similar work with the tree response method in LlamaIndex.

### Can I save or load?

The `Docs` class can be pickled and unpickled.
This is useful if you want to save the embeddings of the documents and then load them later.

```python
import pickle

# save
with open("my_docs.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(docs, f)

# load
with open("my_docs.pkl", "rb") as f:
    docs = pickle.load(f)
```

## Reproduction

Contained in [docs/2024-10-16_litqa2-splits.json5](docs/2024-10-16_litqa2-splits.json5)
are the question IDs used in train, evaluation, and test splits,
as well as paper DOIs used to build the splits' indexes.

- Train and eval splits: question IDs come from
  [LAB-Bench's LitQA2 question IDs](https://github.com/Future-House/LAB-Bench/blob/main/LitQA2/litqa-v2-public.jsonl).
- Test split: questions IDs come from
  [aviary-paper-data's LitQA2 question IDs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/futurehouse/aviary-paper-data).

There are multiple papers slowly building PaperQA, shown below in [Citation](#citation).
To reproduce:

- `skarlinski2024language`: train and eval splits are applicable.
  The test split remains held out.
- `narayanan2024aviarytraininglanguageagents`: train, eval, and test splits are applicable.

Example on how to use LitQA for evaluation can be found in
[aviary.litqa](https://github.com/Future-House/aviary/tree/main/packages/litqa#running-litqa).
