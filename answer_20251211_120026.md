## Research Question

Design of a therapeutic candidate for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC): A mini-binder strategy targeting the TNFα–ΔNp63α axis. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that is negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 expression. Because existing targeted therapy options are limited and recurrence rates are high, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. ΔNp63α is known as an important biomarker and potential therapeutic target in TNBC, and studies have reported that ΔNp63α degradation can be induced through TNFα signaling. The goal of this problem is to discover an AI-designed protein binder that selectively binds to the TNF receptor (TNFR). The design should maximize binding specificity and minimize adverse effects, off-target interactions, and immunogenicity. Because TNFR1 and TNFR2 induce distinct biological outcomes, the design should incorporate pathway-biased modulation—selectively activating or inhibiting a chosen pathway. Among possible classes of binders, this problem focuses on designing mini-binder candidates. Design a binder discovery pipeline that includes all of the following functionalities. For each step, describe the tools used, the reasons for choosing them, alternative approaches, and how each step’s output connects to the next step.
1. Selection of TNFR1/2 binding sites for the binder
2. Incorporation of biophysical constraints (length, charge, stability, manufacturability, etc.)
3. Sequence design of candidate binders
4. Prediction or analysis of candidate binder–TNFR1/2 binding structure and binding characteristics (KD, kon, koff, etc.)
5. Off-target receptor search and binding likelihood assessment
6. Prioritization and ranking of candidate sequences (ranking criteria and justification).

## Final Answer

Based on the collaborative analysis of the Structural Biologist, AI Protein Design Specialist, Computational Systems Pharmacologist, and Critic, here is the comprehensive design pipeline for a **TNFR1-Selective Trimeric Pro-Agonist** to treat Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).

### **Executive Summary: The Therapeutic Strategy**
To induce **$\Delta$Np63$\alpha$ degradation** via the IKK$\beta$ pathway (Chatterjee et al., *Cancer Res* 2010; Lee et al., *Cell Cycle* 2007), the therapeutic candidate cannot be a simple monomeric binder, which would act as an antagonist. It must be a **C3-symmetric trimeric agonist** that mimics TNF$\alpha$-driven receptor clustering. To resolve the toxicity of systemic TNFR1 activation and the paradox of NF-$\kappa$B-driven survival, the design incorporates a **"Pro-Binder" architecture**: the agonist is masked by an inhibitory domain linked via an **MMP-9 cleavable sequence**, ensuring activation occurs only in the protease-rich TNBC microenvironment.

### **Step 1: Selection of TNFR1 Binding Sites (Epitope Mapping)**
**Goal:** Identify non-conserved "hotspot" residues that drive TNFR1 selectivity over TNFR2 and enable receptor clustering.

*   **Tools:** **MaSIF** (Molecular Surface Interaction Fingerprinting) (Gainza et al., *Nature Methods* 2020) and **PyMOL**.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Structural Alignment:** Align TNFR1 (PDB: 1EXT) and TNFR2 (PDB: 3ALQ).
    2.  **Hotspot Identification:** Instead of targeting the conserved core, select residues corresponding to the TNF$\alpha$ R31/R32 mutation sites, which confer TNFR1 selectivity (Shibata et al., *Biochem Biophys Res Commun* 2008).
    3.  **Population Filtering:** Cross-reference selected TNFR1 residues against the **gnomAD database** to exclude positions with high-frequency missense variants (e.g., R92Q/R121Q) that might alter binding in patient subpopulations (*Autoimmunity Reviews* 2020).
*   **Output:** A set of XYZ coordinates on TNFR1 representing the "lock" for the generative model, excluding TNFR2-conserved regions.

### **Step 2: Incorporation of Biophysical Constraints**
**Goal:** Define the geometric and conditional constraints required for agonism (trimerization) and safety (masking).

*   **Tools:** **RFdiffusion** (configuration settings).
*   **Constraints:**
    1.  **Multivalency (Agonism):** Enforce **C3 symmetry** in the design parameters to generate a trimeric mini-binder. This is critical to mimic the 3:3 stoichiometry of the native TNF$\alpha$-TNFR1 complex required for signal transduction.
    2.  **Pro-Drug Architecture:** Design the construct as `[Mask Domain] - [MMP-9 Linker] - [Mini-Binder]`. The linker sequence (GPQG|IWGQ) targets MMP-9, which is upregulated in Basal-like TNBC (Lin et al., *Aging* 2024; PMID: 38697967).
    3.  **Size & Topology:** Limit the binder subunit to 50-80 residues with high helix/sheet content to ensure stability and tissue penetration.

### **Step 3: Sequence Design of Candidate Binders**
**Goal:** Generate *de novo* sequences that bind TNFR1, avoid TNFR2, and remain inert until cleaved.

*   **Tools:** **RFdiffusion** (Backbone generation), **ProteinMPNN** (Sequence design).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Hotspot-Guided Hallucination:** Use **RFdiffusion** with `interaction_hotspot_potential` targeting the residues identified in Step 1. This "hallucinates" *de novo* backbones that satisfy the binding geometry without rigidly grafting discontinuous native loops (Watson et al., *Nature* 2023).
    2.  **Negative Design (Selectivity):** During **ProteinMPNN** sequence generation (Dauparas et al., *Science* 2022), input TNFR2 structure as a "negative state" to penalize sequences that form favorable interactions with TNFR2.
    3.  **Mask Design:** Run a second round of RFdiffusion in `binder` mode targeting the *mini-binder interface* itself. Design the mask for moderate affinity ($K_D \approx 1-10 \mu$M) ensuring it blocks the binder when linked (high local concentration) but dissociates rapidly after cleavage.

### **Step 4: Prediction of Structure & Binding Characteristics**
**Goal:** Validate that the design forms a stable 3:3 complex capable of driving the transition from Complex I (NF-$\kappa$B) to Complex II (Apoptosis).

*   **Tools:** **AlphaFold-Multimer (v2.3)**, **OpenMM** or **Rosetta FastRelax**.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Stoichiometry Check:** Model the complex as **3 Receptors : 1 Trimeric Binder**.
    2.  **Geometrical Validation:** Measure the distance/angle between TNFR1 C-termini in the model. Deviations from the native active complex suggest the binder acts as an antagonist (blocker) rather than an agonist.
    3.  **Stability Analysis:** Run **MD simulations (OpenMM)** or **FastRelax** to assess the mechanical stability of the complex. High stability is required to induce receptor internalization (Micheau & Tschopp, *Cell* 2003).
*   **Output:** Confirmed agonists with Shape Complementarity (Sc) > 0.7 and low Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) at the trimer interface.

### **Step 5: Off-Target Search & Binding Likelihood**
**Goal:** Prevent toxicity by screening against structural mimics in the TNF Superfamily (TNFSF).

*   **Tools:** **Foldseek**, **AlphaFold-Multimer**.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Structural Proteome Screen:** Query the binder structure against the **Human AlphaFold Protein Structure Database** using **Foldseek** (van Kempen et al., *Nature Biotechnology* 2023).
    2.  **Specific Exclusion:** Filter out candidates with TM-score > 0.5 relative to **Fas (CD95)** or **TRAIL-R** to prevent fatal hepatotoxicity or off-target apoptosis.
    3.  **Interface Verification:** For any hits with high structural similarity, run AlphaFold-Multimer to verify if the *binding interface* is conserved. Reject candidates that show high interface compatibility with off-targets.

### **Step 6: Prioritization and Ranking**
**Goal:** Select the top clinical candidates based on a composite "Developability Index."

*   **Tools:** **NetMHCIIpan-4.0**, **CamSol**.
*   **Ranking Criteria:**
    Rank candidates ($C$) by Score $S_{dev}$:
    $$S_{dev} = w_1(Selectivity) + w_2(Stability) + w_3(Safety)$$
    1.  **Selectivity:** $\Delta$pLDDT(TNFR1) - $\Delta$pLDDT(TNFR2) > Threshold.
    2.  **Stability:** Predicted $\Delta G < -9$ kcal/mol (Prodigy) and Sc > 0.7.
    3.  **Safety (Immunogenicity/Solubility):**
        *   **CamSol** score > 1 (Sormanni et al., *J Mol Biol* 2015).
        *   **NetMHCIIpan-4.0** (Reynisson et al., *Nucleic Acids Res* 2020): No strong binders (<50 nM) to common HLA-DR alleles.
    4.  **PK Feature:** Presence of a conjugation handle (e.g., surface Cysteine) or ABD fusion for half-life extension.

### **Limitations & Next Steps**
*   **The Signaling Paradox:** While the pipeline targets IKK$\beta$-mediated $\Delta$Np63$\alpha$ degradation, IKK$\beta$ also activates NF-$\kappa$B, which promotes survival. The "Pulse-and-Shift" strategy (driving rapid internalization to Complex II) is theoretical and requires rigorous wet-lab validation.
*   **MMP Specificity:** MMP-9 is also upregulated in inflammation (e.g., wound healing). Future iterations may require **logic-gated masks** (e.g., pH-dependent + Protease-dependent) to prevent activation in non-malignant inflammatory tissues.
*   **Geometry:** Designing a *de novo* protein that perfectly recapitulates the angstrom-level trimerization geometry of TNF$\alpha$ is challenging; experimental validation via Yeast Display is the immediate next step.
