Problem 5. [Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis]


Background
In the tumor microenvironment, T cells are subjected to chronic and repeated antigen stimulation over time, leading to the acquisition of a T cell exhaustion program characterized by reduced effector function and altered transcriptional states. As this process progresses, a subset of exhausted T cells is observed to exhibit stress-induced, aging-like transcriptional programs, which may ultimately culminate in cellular senescence and cell death.
In this problem, T cell exhaustion is assumed to represent a progressive trajectory toward aging-like dysfunction and terminal loss of cellular viability. Reversing this trajectory—particularly at critical transition points—can be conceptualized as a form of immune rejuvenation.
You are provided with time-course bulk RNA-seq data of T cells following tumor challenge. Using this dataset, your task is to define and analyze the exhaustion–aging–death axis and propose gene-level intervention targets capable of reversing this progression.
The following publicly available aging-related resources may be used, among others:

Task Overview
Using the provided time-course T cell bulk RNA-seq data, identify candidate rejuvenation targets that could reverse T cell exhaustion and aging-like programs before terminal cell death.
Your analysis should be explicitly grounded in RNA-seq–based evidence and focused on the intersection between exhaustion and aging-like transcriptional states.
(A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs
•	Define a T cell exhaustion score and an aging-like score using transcriptional signatures derived from the time-course data.
•	Visualize and describe how these scores change over time following tumor challenge.
(B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window
•	Identify and define a key transition window along the
“Exhaustion → Aging-Like → Death” axis.
•	Justify why this time interval represents a biologically meaningful state transition, rather than a gradual continuum.
(C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes
•	Propose candidate target genes capable of reversing or disrupting the exhaustion–aging trajectory during the identified transition window.
•	For each proposed target:
o	Specify the direction of intervention: inhibition or activation
o	Provide RNA-seq–based evidence, including:
	Direction of expression change over time
	Network or pathway-level context
	Opposing regulation relative to exhaustion or aging-like signatures
Your reasoning should explicitly connect gene modulation to the expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.
(D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping
•	Using the provided drug–target dataset, identify:
o	Existing drugs or compounds that could modulate the proposed targets
•	Briefly discuss feasibility, specificity, or limitations of these interventions
