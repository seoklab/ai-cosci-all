## Research Question

What is T cell exhaustion?

---

## Final Answer

T cell exhaustion is a distinct differentiation lineage of T cells that arises from chronic antigen stimulation. It is an active process driven by the transcription factor TOX, leading to a progressive loss of "stemness" (TCF-1 expression) and the acquisition of a stable, restrictive chromatin landscape. This epigenetic remodeling prevents the cells from reverting to functional memory cells. Exhausted T cells can be broadly categorized into progenitor exhausted (TPEX) cells, which retain some proliferative capacity and express TCF-1, and terminally exhausted (TEX) cells, which are considered an irreversible "dead end" state with low or no TCF-1 expression. The tumor microenvironment (TME) can accelerate T cell exhaustion. Therapeutic strategies aim to preserve the TPEX pool and mitigate factors in the TME that promote exhaustion. CD39 is a more reliable marker for terminally exhausted cells than TIM-3.
