## Research Question

[P4] Discovery of Therapeutic Targets for Pulmonary Fibrosis: Inhibitor Candidate Design Based on the IL-11 Interaction Network
Pulmonary fibrosis (especially Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF) is a progressive disease characterized by the irreversible hardening and functional decline of lung tissue. A major limitation is that currently approved therapies (e.g., anti-fibrotic agents) cannot entirely halt the disease's progression. Recent research indicates that IL-11 (Interleukin-11) is a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, playing an important role in fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, and inflammation–fibrosis signaling links. It is also gaining attention as a factor associated with tissue aging and systemic aging-related pathophysiology. Newly identified interactors of IL-11 are emerging as core nodes in the fibrosis-aging network.

The objective of this problem is to integrate and analyze the latest literature and data on IL-11 signaling and its associated interactors in pulmonary fibrosis, with the goal of predicting the inhibitory target candidates that can most effectively block the fibrotic pathway and presenting the scientific rationale. 

If necessary, the analysis should also consider how the aging-related pathways involving IL-11 are connected to fibrosis. 

The following roles are required for this:
1. Literature Analysis (latest papers on IL-11, OMICs data, reviews, etc.)
2. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network and Pathway Network Modeling
3. Hypothesis-driven Reasoning (defining the most influential nodes/interactions for fibrosis and aging inhibition)

Present an analysis and design strategy that satisfies both requirements (A) and (B) below.

(A) Analysis of IL-11 and IL-11 Interacting Factors Driving Pulmonary Fibrosis
1. Summarize the roles of IL-11 related to pulmonary fibrosis and aging.
2. Integrate a list of newly reported IL-11 interactors.
3. Model the Protein-Protein Interaction network and fibrosis/aging pathways.
4. Propose final target candidates and rationale.

(B) Proposal for a Binder that can effectively inhibit IL-11 and its Interacting Factors (from a Biologics Design perspective)
1. Define the Target Class and Modality.
2. Binder design strategy (conceptual level).
3. Propose hypotheses regarding the efficacy on fibrosis and aging inhibition, and safety.

## Final Answer

Based on the comprehensive analysis of recent literature (2024–2025) and the integration of biological network modeling, the team proposes **Interleukin-11 (IL-11)** as the optimal therapeutic target for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). We present the design for **"Respi-11,"** a high-affinity monoclonal antibody engineered to neutralize the IL-11 autocrine loop, thereby halting the "TIME" fibrosis pathway and reversing metabolic aging phenotypes.

### **(A) Analysis of IL-11 and Interacting Factors Driving Pulmonary Fibrosis**

**1. The Role of IL-11: From "Keystone" Cytokine to Metabolic Driver**
Recent breakthroughs have redefined IL-11 as the central node linking fibrosis, aging, and metabolic dysfunction in the lung. Unlike IL-6, which is critical for immune defense, IL-11 drives pathology through specific, redundant pathways:
*   **Fibrosis Driver:** IL-11 acts as the obligate downstream effector of TGF-β1. It stimulates the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) primarily via the **MEK/ERK** pathway, which is dominant in lung fibroblasts over the canonical STAT3 pathway *[Widjaja et al., Nature 2024]*.
*   **Aging & Senescence:** IL-11 is a core component of the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). It functions in an autocrine loop to maintain cellular senescence, preventing tissue regeneration.
*   **Metabolic Reprogramming:** A critical new finding is that IL-11 induces the **Warburg Effect** (aerobic glycolysis) in fibroblasts. The activation of ERK stabilizes **HIF-1$\alpha$**, which drives glycolysis to fuel the high energy demands of collagen synthesis *[Xie Y et al., 2024]*.

**2. The Verified Interaction Network: The "TIME" Pathway**
We have modeled the core signaling axis driving pulmonary fibrosis, termed the **"TIME" Pathway** (**T**GF-β1 / **I**L-11 / **M**EK / **E**RK).

*   **Upstream Repressors (The Aging Trigger):** **Bmi-1** and the Vitamin D Receptor (**VDR**) normally repress the *IL11* gene. In aging or Vitamin D deficiency, levels of Bmi-1/VDR decline, unleashing unchecked IL-11 expression *[Zhang J et al., 2025]*.
*   **Core Signaling Hub:**
    *   **Ligand:** **IL-11** (Target).
    *   **Receptor Complex:** **IL-11R$\alpha$** (Specificity) + **gp130** (Transducer).
*   **Downstream Effectors:**
    *   **MEK/ERK:** Drives FMT and ECM production (Collagen, Fibronectin).
    *   **HIF-1$\alpha$:** Drives metabolic reprogramming (Glycolysis/Lactate).
*   **Excluded Node:** **Metadherin (MTDH)** was analyzed but excluded from the lung network as recent evidence *[Wang X et al., 2025]* confirms it is a kidney-specific fibrosis target.

**3. Rationale for Target Selection**
*   **Target:** **IL-11 Ligand (Soluble & Matrix-Associated)**.
*   **Why Ligand vs. Receptor?** Targeting the ligand prevents it from engaging IL-11R$\alpha$ initially. Since IL-11R$\alpha$ is highly expressed on fibroblasts, blocking the ligand prevents the accumulation of the cytokine on the cell surface ("affinity sink" effect).
*   **Why IL-11 vs. gp130?** Blocking gp130 is toxic because it inhibits homeostatic cytokines (IL-6, LIF, OSM). IL-11 signals via a specific alpha-receptor, so its inhibition is selective and safe.

### **(B) Proposal for a Binder: "Respi-11"**

**1. Target Class and Modality**
*   **Target:** Interleukin-11 (IL-11).
*   **Modality:** **Humanized IgG4 Monoclonal Antibody**.
    *   *Rationale:* The IgG4 isotype has a "silenced" Fc region, preventing Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). This ensures that while the signaling is blocked, the lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells are not destroyed by the immune system, preserving tissue integrity.

**2. Binder Design Strategy**
*   **Mechanism of Action:** **Site I Blockade**.
    *   The mAb will bind to the **Site I interface** of IL-11, which is responsible for the initial high-affinity tethering to **IL-11R$\alpha$**.
    *   *Advantage:* By blocking Site I, we prevent IL-11 from docking onto the cell surface entirely. This is superior to blocking Site II (gp130 recruitment), as it prevents the local concentration of cytokine in the fibrotic niche.
*   **Affinity Optimization:** **$K_D < 10 \text{ pM}$**.
    *   *Requirement:* IL-11 acts in an autocrine manner (secreted by a cell to signal to itself), creating extremely high local concentrations. An ultra-high affinity binder is required to outcompete the native receptor.

**3. Efficacy & Safety Hypotheses**
*   **Efficacy Hypothesis (Dual-Mechanism):**
    1.  **Anti-Fibrotic:** "Respi-11" will collapse the "TIME" pathway (TGF-β1 $\to$ IL-11 $\to$ ERK), halting collagen deposition.
    2.  **Metabolic Rejuvenation:** By blocking the ERK/HIF-1$\alpha$ axis, the binder will reverse the Warburg effect, restoring mitochondrial respiration and reducing lactate production *[Xie Y et al., 2024]*.
*   **Safety Hypothesis:**
    *   IL-11 is evolutionarily redundant in healthy adults. Genetic ablation of *Il11* or *Il11ra1* in mice extends healthspan without toxicity.
    *   Conversely, *administration* of therapeutic IL-11 has been shown to cause acute heart failure *[Sweeney M et al., 2024]*, reinforcing that *removing* this pathological cytokine is the safer strategy.

**4. Experimental Validation Plan**
To confirm efficacy and the specific metabolic mechanism:
*   **In Vitro:** Treat human lung fibroblasts with TGF-β1 +/- Respi-11.
    *   *Readouts:* p-ERK levels, Collagen I, and **Seahorse Assay** (to confirm restoration of Oxygen Consumption Rate vs. Extracellular Acidification Rate).
*   **In Vivo:** Use **Aged Wild-Type mice** challenged with Silica or Bleomycin.
    *   *Note:* We advise caution using Bmi-1 KO mice (as originally suggested) due to systemic frailty; the Silica model described by *Xie Y et al.* is more robust for metabolic validation.
    *   *Biomarkers:* Monitor serum **CCL7** and **TSLP** as pharmacodynamic markers of pathway suppression *[Molyneaux PL et al., 2025]*.
