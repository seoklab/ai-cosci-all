Predicting Drug Repositioning Candidates to Inhibit T-Cell Exhaustion

T-cell exhaustion is a phenomenon in which T cells, repeatedly stimulated under chronic infection or within the tumor microenvironment, lose their functional capacity. It is a major cause of reduced responsiveness to immunotherapy and treatment failure. Discovering drugs or drug combinations that can reverse exhaustion is considered a key challenge in advancing immunotherapy.

The goal of this problem is to integrate publicly available drug–gene/transcriptome databases to predict drug candidates capable of reversing a T-cell exhaustion gene signature, and to provide supporting rationale.

Input Data for this problem: 
exhaustion_signature, which is a list of upregulated and downregulated genes associated with T-cell exhaustion. this data is under the input_dir (data/Q5) with prefixes, Q5.maryphilip. 

Refer to the following Drug-related Open Data:
	•	Drug–target protein/gene association information
	•	Information on drugs that are already used clinically, preclinically, or currently under investigation

Also focus on local pdf literature search first. 

Propose an analytical strategy that satisfies the following requirements.

Key Points
	•	Understanding the drug–target network
	•	Applying a signature-reversal approach based on the exhaustion signature

below are the main questions that should ultimately satisfy the
requirements. answer each in detail. It's not that there should be a team for
each question, same team can participate in multiple questions. design the
team and assign roles that best fit the questions. you could re-structure the
teams after rounds if needed.

(A) Analysis of the T-cell Exhaustion Signature

(B) Candidate Discovery Using Drug–Gene Network Analysis. Here the candidate is a drug candidate that can reverse exhaustion.
