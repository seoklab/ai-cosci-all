## Research Question

[P3] Designing a Therapeutic Mini-binder Candidate for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC): Targeting the TNFɑ-ΔNP63ɑ Axis

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer where Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and HER2 expression are all negative. Due to limited conventional targeted therapeutic options and high recurrence rates, there is a critical need for new treatment strategies. ΔNp63ɑ is known as an important biomarker and potential therapeutic target in TNBC, and it has been reported that TNFɑ signaling can induce ΔNp63ɑ degradation.

The objective of this problem is to discover a protein binder that selectively binds to the TNF receptor (TNFR) through AI-based design. The process aims to maximize the binder's binding specificity while minimizing side effects, off-target reactions, and immunogenicity. 

Considering that TNFR1 and TNFR2 induce different biological effects, the design must also incorporate pathway-specific bias to selectively activate or inhibit one pathway over the other.

In this problem, we will design a mini-binder candidate among various protein binder options. 

Design a binder discovery pipeline that includes all the functionalities listed below. 

Specifically describe the type of tool to be used in each step, the reason for selection, alternative approaches, and how the output of each tool connects as input to the next step.
1. Selection of the Binder Binding Site on TNFR1/2.
2. Incorporation of the Binder's Biophysical Constraints (e.g., length, charge, stability, manufacturability).
3. Candidate Binder Sequence Design.
4. Prediction or Analysis of the Binding Structure and Characteristics between the candidate binder and TNFR1/2 (KD, kon, koff, etc.).
5. Off-target Receptor Search and Binding Potential Assessment.
6. Prioritization and Indexing of Candidate Sequences (Propose ranking criteria and justification for selection).

## Final Answer

Based on the collaborative analysis of the AI Protein Design Specialist, Computational Biophysicist, and Immuno-Oncology Systems Biologist, with critical quality control applied, we present the final computational pipeline.

### **Executive Summary**
To design a therapeutic mini-binder for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) that induces $\Delta$Np63$\alpha$ degradation, the team has determined that the binder must function as a **TNFR Agonist**. Since the degradation mechanism relies on recruiting E3 ligases (e.g., c-IAP/TRAF2/Itch) via the TNF signaling axis, the binder must structurally enforce **receptor trimerization**. Consequently, our pipeline pivots from standard monomeric design to **C3-symmetric *de novo* design**, creating a homotrimeric mini-protein that clusters TNFR1 selectively while avoiding TNFR2 to prevent pro-survival signaling.

### **Step-by-Step Computational Pipeline**

#### **1. Selection of the Binder Binding Site on TNFR1/2**
*   **Objective:** Identify a unique surface "fingerprint" on TNFR1 effective for clustering that is distinct from TNFR2.
*   **Tools:** **MaSIF (Molecular Surface Interaction Fingerprinting)** and **PyMOL**.
*   **Data Sources:** TNFR1 Structure (PDB: **1EXT** or **1TNR**); TNFR2 Structure (PDB: **3ALQ**).
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Align TNFR1 and TNFR2 structures to isolate the Ligand-Binding Domains (CRD2 and CRD3).
    2.  Use **MaSIF** (Gainza et al., *Nature Methods* 2020) to generate geometric and chemical surface fingerprints.
    3.  Identify "hotspots" (binding epitopes) on TNFR1 that possess unique topographic features compared to TNFR2, specifically targeting the "knuckle" region where native TNF$\alpha$ engages.
    4.  *Reference:* Mukai et al. (*PMID: 21081755*) identified specific non-conserved residues in the CRD loops suitable for differentiating receptor isoforms.
*   **Input $\rightarrow$ Output:** Input PDBs; Output is a set of target residue coordinates (hotspots) for the guiding potential.

#### **2. Biophysical Constraints & Backbone Generation (The Agonist Architecture)**
*   **Objective:** Generate a stable, trimeric backbone that clusters three TNFR1 receptors.
*   **Tool:** **RFdiffusion (RosettaFold Diffusion)** with **Symmetry Constraints**.
*   **Reason for Selection:** Standard monomeric binders act as antagonists (blockers). To induce signaling, we use RFdiffusion's ability to hallucinate symmetric oligomers (Watson et al., *Nature* 2023).
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `--symmetry "c3"`: Enforces a cyclic trimeric architecture (homotrimer).
    *   `potentials.guiding_potentials`: Fixes the binder interface to the hotspots identified in Step 1.
    *   `contigmap`: Length 50–80 residues per monomer (mini-binder size for tumor penetration).
    *   **Geometric Constraint:** The trimer diameter must approximate native TNF$\alpha$ (~30–40Å spacing between receptor binding sites) to ensure correct intracellular domain clustering.
*   **Input $\rightarrow$ Output:** Target hotspots; Output is ~1,000 C3-symmetric backbone PDBs.

#### **3. Candidate Binder Sequence Design**
*   **Tool:** **ProteinMPNN** (specifically `MPNN-Fast` or `LigandMPNN`).
*   **Reason for Selection:** Superiority in generating soluble sequences for fixed backbones compared to Rosetta (Dauparas et al., *Science* 2022).
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Use **Symmetric Mode** (`--tied_positions`): This forces the model to predict identical amino acids for the corresponding positions in all three chains (Chain A, B, and C).
    *   This ensures the final construct is encoded by a single gene that self-assembles into a trimer.
*   **Input $\rightarrow$ Output:** RFdiffusion backbones; Output is ~5–10 sequences per backbone (FASTA).

#### **4. Structure Prediction & Binding Analysis**
*   **Tool:** **AlphaFold-Multimer (v2.3)**.
*   **Reason for Selection:** Gold standard for verifying interface quality (ipTM) and quaternary structure assembly (pAE).
*   **Analysis Metrics:**
    *   **Assembly Check:** Verify the oligomer forms a trimer in isolation (Self-interaction pAE < 5Å).
    *   **Affinity Proxy:** **ipTM** (Interface Predicted Template Modeling score) > 0.8.
    *   **Geometric Validation:** Calculate **RMSD** of the predicted Binder:(TNFR1)$_3$ complex relative to the native TNF$\alpha$:(TNFR1)$_3$ complex to ensure the signaling geometry is preserved.
*   **Input $\rightarrow$ Output:** Sequences; Output is high-confidence structural models with error metrics.

#### **5. Off-target Receptor Search & Safety**
*   **Objective:** Ensure pathway bias (Selectivity) and safety.
*   **Tools:** **AlphaFold-Multimer** (Targeted) and **Foldseek** (Global).
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Selectivity Screen:** Dock the designed trimer against the *off-target* receptor (TNFR2). Calculate the `ipTM` difference.
    2.  **Global Toxicity:** Use **Foldseek** to scan the binder backbone against the entire PDB. Discard candidates with structural mimicry to known toxins or immunogenic folds.
    3.  **Immunogenicity:** Screen sequences using **NetMHCpan** or **MHCFlurry 2.0** to filter out strong MHC-II binders.
*   **Input $\rightarrow$ Output:** A filtered list of "selective" agonists.

#### **6. Prioritization and Indexing**
Candidates will be ranked using the **Therapeutic Agonist Index**, a composite score normalized to address unit disparities (correcting the mathematical flaw identified in the critique):

$$ \text{Index} = (0.4 \times \text{ipTM}_{\text{TNFR1}}) + (0.4 \times \Delta \text{Selectivity}) + (0.2 \times \text{Developability}) $$

Where:
*   **Agonism:** $\text{ipTM}_{\text{TNFR1}}$ (Target binding confidence, 0–1 scale).
*   **$\Delta$ Selectivity:** Normalized gap: $\frac{\text{ipTM}_{\text{TNFR1}} - \text{ipTM}_{\text{TNFR2}}}{\text{ipTM}_{\text{TNFR1}}}$ (Ensures dominance of the target pathway).
*   **Developability:** Average of normalized **pLDDT** (stability) and **NetSolP** (solubility) scores.

### **Limitations & Next Steps**
1.  **Oligomer Stability:** Non-covalent homotrimers may dissociate at low concentrations in the blood.
    *   *Next Step:* If dissociation is predicted (via Rosetta `dG_separated`), engineer disulfide bridges between subunits or fuse the trimer to a rigid scaffold (e.g., Ferritin or Fc-knob-in-hole).
2.  **Pathway Verification:** While we target TNFR1 for $\Delta$Np63$\alpha$ degradation, the specific E3 ligase recruitment must be verified experimentally.
    *   *Next Step:* In vitro ubiquitination assays using the top 5 ranked binders.
