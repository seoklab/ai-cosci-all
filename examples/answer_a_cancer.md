# AI-Generated Answer A: Cancer Mechanisms

## Overview
Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. The molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development involve multiple pathways and genetic alterations.

## Key Molecular Mechanisms

### 1. Oncogene Activation
Proto-oncogenes such as RAS, MYC, and EGFR can become activated through mutations, amplifications, or chromosomal translocations. For example, RAS mutations occur in approximately 30% of all cancers and lead to constitutive growth signaling.

**Evidence:** "RAS mutations in human cancer" (PMID: 12068308) demonstrates that mutant RAS proteins drive tumor progression through multiple downstream pathways including PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling.

### 2. Tumor Suppressor Inactivation
Critical tumor suppressors like p53 and RB are frequently inactivated in cancer:
- p53 mutations occur in >50% of cancers
- Loss of p53 function eliminates cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis

**Citation:** "p53: guardian of the genome" (PMID: 8242752) established p53's central role in preventing cancer development.

### 3. DNA Repair Defects
Defective DNA repair mechanisms contribute to genomic instability:
- BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in breast/ovarian cancer
- Mismatch repair deficiency in colorectal cancer

### 4. Telomere Maintenance
Cancer cells achieve immortalization through telomerase reactivation, overcoming normal cellular senescence limits.

## Conclusion
Cancer arises through accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations affecting cell cycle control, DNA repair, and growth signaling pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies.

## Limitations
This overview focuses on well-established mechanisms. Emerging areas like cancer stem cells, tumor microenvironment interactions, and epigenetic regulation require further investigation.
